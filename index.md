This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python
for librarians with little or no previous programming experience.
It uses examples that are relevant to a wide range of library use cases, and is designed to be used as a prerequisite for other Python lessons that will be developed in the future (e.g., web scraping, APIs).

This lesson uses the JupyterLab computing environment and Python 3.
