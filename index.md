## Major lesson update: June 14, 2024
The Python Intro for Libraries lesson has had a major redesign and will replace this lesson on June 14, 2024. The new Python lesson features a different dataset (of library usage data) and uses JupyterLab (instead of Spyder). Due to the scope of changes, the lesson was developed [in a separate GitHub repository](https://github.com/chennesy/lc-python-intro).

- If you are planning to teach the Python for Librarians lesson *before* June 14, 2024 we advise teaching [the new lesson](https://github.com/chennesy/lc-python-intro) from this fork.
- If you are planning to teach the lesson *after* June 14, 2024, this lesson will be up to date, and you can prepare to teach using the [forked version](https://github.com/chennesy/lc-python-intro).
 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python
for librarians with little or no previous programming experience.
It uses examples that are relevant to a wide range of library use cases,
and is designed to be used as a prerequisite lesson for other Python based lessons
that will be developed in the future, e.g. using the Pandas for data analysis.

This lesson references the Spyder IDE,
but can be taught using a regular Python interpreter as well.
Please note that this lesson uses Python 3 rather than Python 2.

## Under Design

**This lesson is currently in its early design stage;
please check [the design notes](instructors/design.md)
to see what we have so far.
Contributions are very welcome:
we would be particularly grateful for exercises
and for commentary on the ones already there.**
