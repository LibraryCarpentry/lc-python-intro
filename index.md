## Major lesson update in early 2024 
The Python Intro for Libraries lesson is currently begin redeveloped. The new Python lesson will feature a different dataset (of library usage data) and will use JupyterLab (instead of Spyder). Due to the scope of changes, the lesson is being updated [in a separate GitHub repository](https://github.com/chennesy/lc-python-intro). Once the redesign is finished that lesson will replace the lesson maintained here. We will post a target date for the change here as soon as we have a clear timeline, but if you are planning to teach this lesson in early 2024 [please add an issue here](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-python-intro/issues) to let us know.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python
for librarians with little or no previous programming experience.
It uses examples that are relevant to a wide range of library use cases,
and is designed to be used as a prerequisite lesson for other Python based lessons
that will be developed in the future, e.g. using the Pandas for data analysis.

This lesson references the Spyder IDE,
but can be taught using a regular Python interpreter as well.
Please note that this lesson uses Python 3 rather than Python 2.

## Under Design

**This lesson is currently in its early design stage;
please check [the design notes](instructors/design.md)
to see what we have so far.
Contributions are very welcome:
we would be particularly grateful for exercises
and for commentary on the ones already there.**
