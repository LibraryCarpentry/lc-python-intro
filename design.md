## Pacing and overall schedule

- Pacing: The modularity of the lesson allows instructors to select the amount of content
  appropriate to the needs of the learners.
- Each module has 15 minutes of stretch content which may be optionally included.
- There is an additional 30 minutes built into the startup time to accomodate delays.

### Possible paths through the lesson

#### Slow morning OR afternoon

- Startup + standard library
- Startup + pandas

#### Average speed morning OR afternoon

- Startup + standard library + pandas
- Startup + standard library + standard library stretch
- Startup + pandas + pandas stretch

#### Full day option

- Startup + standard library + standard library stretch + lunch + pandas + pandas stretch
