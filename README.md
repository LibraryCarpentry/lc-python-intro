# Library Carpentry
The Library Carpentry module Introduction to programming with Python is maintained by [Cody Hennesy](https://github.com/chennesy) and [Scott Peterson](https://github.com/scottcpeterson). 

Previous lesson maintainers include: [Konrad Foerstner](https://github.com/konrad), [Drew Heles](https://github.com/dheles), [Elizabeth Wickes](https://github.com/elliewix), [Laura Wrubel](https://github.com/lwrubel), [Carlos Martinez](https://github.com/c-martinez) and [Richard Vankoningsveld](https://github.com/richyvk).

## Status Note
The maintainers of this lesson are currently working on a substantial redesign that will be integrated into the Library Carpentry curriculum. This means that large portions of the content in this repository will be removed or substantially rewritten. The hope is to move this pre-alpha version to alpha in early 2024--after review by the [LC-CAC](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/curriculum-advisors)--at which point a Pull Request will be made to replace the [current Library Carpentry Python lesson](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-python-intro/).

## Contribution
The most helpful way to contribute at this time is to open an issue with ideas for changes, and/or to volunteer to help out as a maintainer. Please do not make a Pull Request unless you have been in contact with the maintainers since major episode re-writes are currently in process and it may be difficult to merge your changes.
