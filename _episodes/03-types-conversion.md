## Every value has a type.

*   Every value in a program has a specific type.
*   Integer (`int`): whole numbers like 3 or -512.
*   Floating point number (`float`): fractional numbers like 3.14159 or -2.5.
*   Whole numbers may also be stored as floats, e.g. `1.0`, but `1.0` would still be stored as a `float`.
*   Character string (usually called "string", `str`): text.
    *   Written in either single quotes or double quotes (as long as they match).
    *   The quotation marks aren't printed using `print()`, but may appear when viewing a value in the Jupyter Notebook or other Python interpreter.

## Use the built-in function `type` to find the type of a value.

*   Use the built-in function `type` to find out what type a value has.
*   This works on variables as well.
    *   But remember: the *value* has the type --- the *variable* is just a label.
    *   When you change the value of a variable to a new data type, the results of `print(type(your_variable))` will change accordingly.

~~~
print(type(52))
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
<class 'int'>
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
title = 'Biochemistry'
print(type(title))
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
<class 'str'>
~~~
{: .output}

## Types control what operations (or methods) can be performed on a given value.

*   A value's type determines what the program can do to it.

~~~
print(5 - 3)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
2
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
print('hello' - 'h')
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-67f5626a1e07> in <module>()
----> 1 print('hello' - 'h')

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'
~~~
{: .error}

## You can use the `+` and `*` operators on strings.

*   "Adding" character strings concatenates them.

~~~
full_name = 'Ahmed' + ' ' + 'Walsh'
print(full_name)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
Ahmed Walsh
~~~
{: .output}

*   Multiplying a character string by an integer _N_ creates a new string that consists of that character string repeated  _N_ times.
    *   Since multiplication is repeated addition.
* There are more ways that traditional math operators will work on other data types.  There isn't a perfect formula for figuring out what they do, so experimentation is valuable.

~~~
separator = '=' * 10
print(separator)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
==========
~~~
{: .output}

## Strings have a length (but numbers don't).

*   The built-in function `len` counts the number of characters in a string.

~~~
print(len(full_name))
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
11
~~~
{: .output}

*   But numbers don't have a length (not even zero).

~~~
print(len(52))
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-3-f769e8e8097d> in <module>()
----> 1 print(len(52))

TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()
~~~
{: .error}

## Must convert numbers to strings or vice versa when operating on them.

*   Cannot add numbers and strings.

~~~
print(1 + 'A')
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-4-fe4f54a023c6> in <module>()
----> 1 print(1 + '2')

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
~~~
{: .error}

*   Not allowed because it's ambiguous: should `1 + '2'` be `3` or `'12'`?
*   Some types can be converted to other types by using the type name as a function.

~~~
print(1 + int('2'))
print(str(1) + '2')
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
3
12
~~~
{: .output}

## Can mix integers and floats freely in operations.

*   Integers and floating-point numbers can be mixed in arithmetic.
    *   Python automatically converts integers to floats as needed.

~~~
print('half is', 1 / 2.0)
print('three squared is', 3.0 ** 2)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
half is 0.5
three squared is 9.0
~~~
{: .output}

## Variables only change value when something is assigned to them.

*   If we make one cell in a spreadsheet depend on another,
    and update the latter,
    the former updates automatically.
*   This does **not** happen in programming languages.

~~~
first = 1
second = 5 * first
first = 2
print('first is', first, 'and second is', second)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
first is 2 and second is 5
~~~
{: .output}

*   The computer reads the value of `first` when doing the multiplication,
    creates a new value, and assigns it to `second`.
*   After that, `second` does not remember where it came from.

> ## Division Types
> There are three different types of division:
> 1. 'Normal' division (aka floating-point division) is what most people may be
> familiar with: 5 / 2 = 2.5
> 2. Floor division, which cuts out the part after the period: 5 / 2 = 2
> 3. Modulo division, which only keeps the remained after division: 5 / 2 = 1
>
> In Python 3,  the `/` operator performs floating-point division, the `//`
> operator performs floor division, and the '%' (or *modulo*) operator
> calculates the modulo division:
>
> ~~~
> print('5 // 3:', 5//3)
> print('5 / 3:', 5/3)
> print('5 % 3:', 5%3)
> ~~~
> {: .python}

> 5 // 3: 1
> 5 / 3: 1.6666666666666667

> If `num_students` is the number of students enrolled in a course (let say 600),
> and `num_per_class` is the number that can attend a single class (let say 42),

> to teach everyone.
>
> > ## Solution
> > Depending on requirements it might be important to detect when the number of students per class doesn't divide the
> > number of students evenly. Detect it with the `%` operator and test if the remainder that it returns is greater than
> > 0.

> > ~~~
> > num_students = 600

> ## Strings to Numbers
>
> Where reasonable, `float()` will convert a string to a floating point number,
> and `int()` will convert a floating point number to an integer:
>
> ~~~
> print("string to float:", float("3.4"))
> print("float to int:", int(3.4))
> ~~~
> {: .python}
>
> ~~~
> string to float: 3.4
> float to int: 3

> {: .output}

> **Note:** conversion is some times also called typecast.
>
> If the conversion doesn't make sense, however, an error message will occur

> Which of the following will print 2.0?

> ~~~
