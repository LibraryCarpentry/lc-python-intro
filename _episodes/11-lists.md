## A list stores many values in a single structure.

*   Scenario: You have set up an Arduino to do temperature measurements
    in a storage room for rare books.
*   Doing calculations with a hundred variables called `temperature_001`, `temperature_002`, etc.,
    would be at least as slow as doing them by hand.
*   Use a *list* to store many values together.
    *   Contained within square brackets `[...]`.
    *   Values separated by commas `,`.
*   Use `len` to find out how many values are in a list.

~~~
temperatures = [17.3, 17.5, 17.7, 17.5, 17.6]
print('temperatures:', temperatures)
print('length:', len(temperatures))
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
temperatures: [17.3, 17.5, 17.7, 17.5, 17.6]
length: 5
~~~
{: .output}

## Use an item's index to fetch it from a list.

*   Just like strings.

~~~
print('zeroth item of temperatures:', temperatures[0])
print('fourth item of temperatures:', temperatures[4])
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
zeroth item of temperatures: 17.3
fourth item of temperatures: 17.6
~~~
{: .output}

## Lists' values can be replaced by assigning to them.

*   Use an index expression on the left of assignment to replace a value.

~~~
temperatures[0] = 16.5
print('temperatures is now:', temperatures)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
temperatures is now: [16.5, 17.5, 17.7, 17.5, 17.6]
~~~
{: .output}

## Appending items to a list lengthens it.

*   Use `list_name.append` to add items to the end of a list.

~~~
print('temperatures is initially:', temperatures)
temperatures.append(17.9)
temperatures.append(18.2)
print('temperatures has become:', temperatures)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
temperatures is initially: [16.5, 17.5, 17.7, 17.5, 17.6]
temperatures has become: [16.5, 17.5, 17.7, 17.5, 17.6, 17.9, 18.2]
~~~
{: .output}

*   `append` is a *method* of lists.
    *   Like a function, but tied to a particular object.
*   Use `object_name.method_name` to call methods.
    *   Deliberately resembles the way we refer to things in a library.
*   We will meet other methods of lists as we go along.
    *   Use `help(list)` for a preview.

## Use `del` to remove items from a list entirely.

*   `del list_name[index]` removes an item from a list and shortens the list.
*   Not a function or a method, but a statement in the language.

~~~
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print('primes before removing last item:', primes)
del primes[4]
print('primes after removing last item:', primes)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
primes before removing last item: [2, 3, 5, 7, 9]
primes after removing last item: [2, 3, 5, 7]
~~~
{: .output}

## The empty list contains no values.

*   Use `[]` on its own to represent a list that doesn't contain any values.
    *   "The zero of lists."
*   Helpful as a starting point for collecting values
    (which we will see in the [next episode]({{page.root}}/12-for-loops/)).

## Lists may contain values of different types.

*   A single list may contain numbers, strings, and anything else.

~~~
goals = [1, 'Create lists.', 2, 'Extract items from lists.', 3, 'Modify lists.']
~~~
{: .python}

## Character strings can be indexed like lists.

*   Get single characters from a character string using indexes in square brackets.

~~~
element = 'carbon'
print('zeroth character:', element[0])
print('third character:', element[3])
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
zeroth character: c
third character: b
~~~
{: .output}

## Character strings are immutable.

*   Cannot change the characters in a string after it has been created.
    *   *Immutable*: cannot be changed after creation.
    *   In contrast, lists are *mutable*: they can be modified in place.
*   Python considers the string to be a single value with parts,
    not a collection of values.

~~~
element[0] = 'C'
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
~~~
{: .error}

*   Lists and character strings are both *collections*.

## Indexing beyond the end of the collection is an error.

*   Python reports an `IndexError` if we attempt to access a value that doesn't exist.
    *   This is a kind of runtime error.
    *   Cannot be detected as the code is parsed
        because the index might be calculated based on data.

~~~
print('99th element of element is:', element[99])
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
IndexError: string index out of range
~~~
