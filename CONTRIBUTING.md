## Contributing

This lesson is derived from Carpentries (Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry,
and Library Carpentry) instructional material. [The Carpentries][cp-site] ([Software Carpentry][swc-site], [Data Carpentry][dc-site], and [Library Carpentry][lc-site]) are open source projects.

In developing the Computing Basics series we welcome bug reports, reviews of proposed changes and fixes to existing material.

### Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our
license](LICENSE.md). In exchange, we will address your issues and/or assess
your change proposal as promptly as we can, and help you become a member of our
community. Everyone involved in the Computing Basics series agrees to abide by
our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### How to Contribute

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a spelling
mistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error. This is a good way to
introduce yourself and to meet some of our community members.

1. If you do not have a [GitHub][github] account, you can [send us comments by
   email][contact]. However, we will be able to respond more quickly if you use
   one of the other methods described below.

2. If you have a [GitHub][github] account, or are willing to [create
   one][github-join], but do not know how to use Git, you can report problems
   or suggest improvements by [creating an issue][repo-issues]. This allows us
   to assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

3. If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to add or change material,
   you can submit a pull request (PR). Instructions for doing this are
   [included below](#using-github).

Note: if you want to build the website locally, please refer to [The Workbench
documentation][template-doc].

### Where to Contribute

If you wish to change this lesson, add issues and pull requests in this [repo].

### What to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, from writing new exercises and improving
existing ones to updating or filling in the documentation and submitting [bug
reports][issues] about things that do not work, are not clear, or are missing.
If you are looking for ideas, please see [the list of issues for this
repository][repo-issues].

Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are just as welcome: we are
smarter together than we are on our own. **Reviews from novices and newcomers
are particularly valuable**: it's easy for people who have been using these
lessons for a while to forget how impenetrable some of this material can be, so
fresh eyes are always welcome.

### What *Not* to Contribute

Carpentries lessons already contain more material than we can cover in a typical
Computing Basics workshop, so we are usually *not* looking for more concepts or tools to add to them.

We are also not looking for exercises or other material that only run on one
platform. Workshops may contain a mixture of Windows, macOS, and
Linux users; in order to be usable, lessons should run equally well on all
three.

### Using GitHub

If you choose to contribute via GitHub, you may want to look at [How to
Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute]. In brief, we
use [GitHub flow][github-flow] to manage changes:

1. Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each
   significant change.
2. Commit the change in that branch.
3. Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub.
4. Submit a pull request from that branch to the [upstream repository][repo].
5. If you receive feedback, make changes on your desktop and push to your
   branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically.

NB: The published copy of the lesson is usually in the `main` branch.

The Computing Basics series is run by a small group of volunteers. `cb-admins` can be [reached by email][contact] and have final say over what gets merged into the lesson.

### Acknowledgements

The Computing Basics series is grateful to the Carpentries for their generosity in sharing lesson materials and infrastructure. Materials created for the Computing Basics series has borrowed heavily from Carpentries sources and the series would be vastly different without the resources freely offered by the Carpentries.

By keeping material adaptation in GitHub, we offer the history of this repo to indicate changes made to the original Carpentries source material.
