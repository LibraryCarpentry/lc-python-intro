    "- [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) is a style guide for Python that discusses topics such as how you should name variables, how you should use indentation in your code, how you should structure your `import` statements, etc. Following PEP8 guidelines makes it easier for other Python developers (and for your future self) to read and understand your code.\n",

    "- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is the home of the Pandas data library.\n",
    "- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a helpful site collecting community questions and answers related to programming challenges. Most of the issues you're likely to run into as a Python novice have probably been answered there.\n",

    "1. when you structure your questions using [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode), by breaking down the programming task you hope to accomplish using natural language.\n",
    "2. when you have enough experience in Python that you can troubleshoot errors and read over the code to ensure it's doing what you think it is. The Python code that ChatGPT suggests can be flawed in small (and sometimes large) ways. You'll have more success using generative AI for programming help as you gain more experience writing and editing Python.\n"
