::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Use variables to store values.

Variables are names given to certain values. In Python the `=` symbol assigns a value to a variable. Here, Python assigns the number `42` to the variable `age` and the name `Ahmed` in single quote to a variable `name`.

```python
age = 42
name = 'Ahmed'
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout
## Naming variables
Variable names:

  - cannot start with a digit
  - cannot contain spaces, quotation marks, or other punctuation
  - *may* contain an underscore (typically used to separate words in long variable names)
  - are case sensitive. `name` and `Name` would be different variables.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Use `print()` to display values.

You can print Python objects to the Jupyter notebook output using the built-in function, `print()`. Inside of the parentheses we can add the objects that we want print, which are known as the `print()` function's arguments.  

```python
print(name, age)
```

```output
Ahmed 42 
```

In Jupyter notebooks, you can leave out the `print()` function for objects -- such as variables -- that are on the last line of a cell. If the final line of Jupyter cell includes the name of a variable, its value will display in the notebook when you run the cell.

```python
name
age
```

```output
42
```

## Format output with f-strings

You can format variables and other Python objects as text strings in your output using an f-string. To do so, start a string with `f` before the open single (or double) quote. Then add any replacement fields, such as variable names, between curly braces `{}`. 

```python
f'{name} is {age} years old'
```

```output
'Ahmed is 42 years old'
```

## Variables must be created before they are used.

If a variable doesn't exist yet, or if the name has been misspelled, Python reports an error called a `NameError`.

```python
print(eye_color)
```

```error
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-c1fbb4e96102> in <module>()
----> 1 print(eye_color)

NameError: name 'eye_color' is not defined
```

The last line of an error message is usually the most informative. In this case it tells us that the `eye_color` variable is not defined. NameErrors often refer to variables that haven't been created or assigned yet.

## Variables can be used in calculations.

We can use variables in calculations as if they were values. We assigned 42 to `age` a few lines ago, so we can reference that value within a new variable assignment.

```python
age = age + 3
f'Age equals: {age}'
```

```output
Age equals: 45
```

## Every Python object has a type.

Everything in Python is some type of object and every Python object will be of a specific type. Understanding an object's type will help you know what you can and can't do with that object. 

You can use the built-in Python function `type()` to find out an object's type. 

```python
print(type(140.2), 
      type(age), 
      type(name), 
      type(print))
```

```output
<class 'float'> <class 'int'> <class 'str'> <class 'builtin_function_or_method'>
```

1. 140.2 is an example of a floating point number or `float`. These are fractional numbers. 
2. The value of the `age` variable is 45, which is a whole number, or integer (`int`).
3. The `name` variable refers to the string (`str`) of 'Ahmed'.
4. The built-in Python function `print()` is also an object with a type, in this case it's a `builtin_function_or_method`. Built-in functions refer to those that are included in the core Python library.

## Types control what operations (or methods) can be performed on objects.

An object's type determines what the program can do with it.

```python
5 - 3
```

```output
2
```

We get an error if we try to subtract a letter from a string:

```python
'hello' - 'h'
```

```error
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-67f5626a1e07> in <module>()
----> 1 'hello' - 'h'

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'
```

## Use an index to get a single character from a string.

We can reference the specific location of a character (individual letters, numbers, and so on) in a string by using its index position. In Python, each character in a string (first, second, etc.) is given a number, which is called an index. Indexes begin from 0 rather than 1. We can use an index in square brackets to refer to the character at that position.

```python
library = 'Alexandria'
library[0]
```

```output
A
```

## Use a slice to get multiple characters from a string.

A slice is a part of a string that we can reference using `[start:stop]`, where `start` is the index of the first character we want and `stop` is the last character. Referencing a string slice does not change the contents of the original string. Instead, the slice returns a copy of the part of the original string we want. 

```python
library[0:3]
```

```output
Ale
```

Note that in the example above, `library[0:3]` begins with zero, which refers to the first element in the string, and ends with a 3. When working with slices the end point is interpreted as going up to, *but not including* the index number provided. In other words, the character in the index position of 3 in the string `Alexandria` is `x`, so the slice `[0:3]` will go up to but not include that character, and therefore give us `Ale`.

## Use the built-in function `len` to find the length of a string.

The `len()`function will tell us the length of an item. In the case of a string, it will tell us how many characters are in the string. 

```python
len('Babel')
```

```output
5
```

## Variables only change value when something is assigned to them.

Once a Python variable is assigned it will not change value unless the code is run again. The value of `older_age` below does not get updated when we change the value of `age` to `50`, for example:

```python
age = 42
older_age = age + 3
age = 50
f'Older age is {older_age} and age is {age}'
```

```output
Older age is 45 and age is 50
```

A variable in Python is analogous to a sticky note with a name written on it: assigning a value to a variable is like putting a sticky note on a particular value. When we assigned the variable `older_age`, it was like we put a sticky note with the name `older_age` on the value of `45`. Remember, `45` was the result of `age + 3` because `age` at that point in the code was equal to `42`. The `older_age` sticky note (variable) was never attached to (assigned to) another value, so it doesn't change when the `age` variable is updated to be `50`.

## Swapping Values

Draw a table showing the values of the variables in this program
after each statement is executed.
In simple terms, what do the last three lines of this program do?

```python
x = 1.0
y = 3.0
swap = x
x = y
y = swap
```

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```
swap = x  #  x = 1.0 y = 3.0 swap = 1.0
x = y     #  x = 3.0 y = 3.0 swap = 1.0
y = swap  #  x = 3.0 y = 1.0 swap = 1.0
```

These three lines exchange the values in `x` and `y` using the `swap`
variable for temporary storage. This is a fairly common programming idiom.

## Predicting Values

What is the final value of `position` in the program below?
(Try to predict the value without running the program,
then check your prediction.)

```python
initial = "left"
position = initial
initial = "right"
```

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```python
initial = "left"  # Initial is assigned the string "left"
position = initial  # Position is assigned the variable initial, currently "left"
initial = "right"  # Initial is assigned the string "right"
print(position)
```

```output
left
```

The last assignment to position was "left"

## Can you slice integers?

If you assign `a = 123`,
what happens if you try to get the second digit of `a`?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

Numbers are not stored in the written representation,
so they can't be treated like strings.

```python
a = 123
print(a[1])
```

```error
TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable
```

## Slicing

We know how to slice using an explicit start and end point:

```python
library_name = 'Library of Babel'
f'library_name[1:3] is: {library_name[1:3]}'
```
```output
'library_name[1:3] is: ib'
```

But we can also use implicit and negative index values when we define a slice. Try the following (replacing `low` and `high` with index positions of your choosing) to figure out how these different forms of slicing work:

1. What does `library_name[low:]` (without a value after the colon) do?
2. What does `library_name[:high]` (without a value before the colon) do?
3. What does `library_name[:]` (just a colon) do?
4. What does `library_name[number:negative-number]` do?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

1. It will slice the string, starting at the `low` index and stopping at the end of the string.
2. It will slice the string, starting at the beginning on the string, and ending an element before the `high` index.
3. It will print the entire string.
4. It will slice the string, starting the `number` index, and ending a distance of the absolute value of `negative-number` elements from the end of the string.

## Fractions

What type of value is 3.4?
How can you find out?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

It is a floating-point number (often abbreviated "float").

```python
print(type(3.4))
```

```output
<class 'float'>
```

## Automatic Type Conversion

What type of value is 3.25 + 4?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

It is a float: integers are automatically converted to floats as necessary.

```python
result = 3.25 + 4
print(result, 'is', type(result))
```

```output
7.25 is <class 'float'>
```
