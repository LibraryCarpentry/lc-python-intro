::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Write programs that assign values to variables and perform calculations with those values.
- Correctly trace value changes in programs that use assignment.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How can I store data in programs?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Use variables to store values.

- Variables are names for values.
- In Python the `=` symbol assigns the value on the right to the name on the left.
- The variable is created when a value is assigned to it.
- Here, Python assigns an age to a variable `age`
  and a name in quotation marks to a variable `first_name`.

```python
age = 42
first_name = 'Ahmed'
```

- Variable names:
  - cannot start with a digit
  - cannot contain spaces, quotation marks, or other punctuation
  - *may* contain an underscore (typically used to separate words in long variable names)
- Underscores at the start like `__alistairs_real_age` have a special meaning
  so we won't do that until we understand the convention.

## Use `print` to display values.

- Python has a built-in function called `print` that prints things as text.
- Call the function (i.e., tell Python to run it) by using its name.
- Provide values to the function (i.e., the things to print) in parentheses.
- To add a string to the printout, wrap the string in single quotations.
- The values passed to the function are called 'arguments'

```python
print(first_name, 'is', age, 'years old')
```

```output
Ahmed is 42 years old
```

- `print` automatically puts a single space between items to separate them.
- And wraps around to a new line at the end.

## Variables must be created before they are used.

- If a variable doesn't exist yet, or if the name has been mis-spelled,
  Python reports an error.
  - Unlike some languages, which "guess" a default value.

```python
print(eye_color)
```

```error
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-c1fbb4e96102> in <module>()
----> 1 print(eye_color)

NameError: name 'eye_color' is not defined
```

- The last line of an error message is usually the most informative.
- We will look at error messages in detail [later](05-error-messages).

## Variables Persist Between Cells

Variables defined in one cell exist in all other cells once executed,
so the relative location of cells in the notebook do not matter
(i.e., cells lower down can still affect those above).
Remember: Notebook cells are just a way to organize a program:
as far as Python is concerned,
all of the source code is one long set of instructions.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Variables can be used in calculations.

- We can use variables in calculations just as if they were values.
  - Remember, we assigned 42 to `age` a few lines ago.

```python
age = age + 3
print('Age in three years:', age)
```

```output
Age in three years: 45
```

## Use an index to get a single character from a string.

- The characters (individual letters, numbers, and so on) in a string are
  ordered. For example, the string 'AB' is not the same as 'BA'. Because of
  this ordering, we can treat the string as a list of characters.
- Each position in the string (first, second, etc.) is given a number. This
  number is called an index or sometimes a subscript.
- Indices are numbered from 0 rather than 1.
- Use the position's index in square brackets to get the character at that
  position.

```python
element = 'helium'
print(element[0])
```

```output
h
```

## Use a slice to get a substring.

- A part of a string is called a substring. A substring can be as short as a
  single character.
- An item in a list is called an element. Whenever we treat a string as if it
  were a list, the string's elements are its individual characters.
- A slice is a part of a string (or, more generally, any list-like thing).
- We take a slice by using `[start:stop]`, where `start` is replaced with the
  index of the first element we want and `stop` is replaced with the index of
  the element just after the last element we want.
- Â  Mathematically, you might say that a slice selects `[start:stop]`.
- The difference between stop and start is the slice's length.
- Taking a slice does not change the contents of the original string. Instead,
  the slice is a copy of part of the original string.

```python
element = 'sodium'
print(element[0:3])
```

```output
sod
```

## Use the built-in function `len` to find the length of a string.

```python
print(len('helium'))
```

```output
6
```

- Nested functions are evaluated from the inside out,
  just like in mathematics.

## Python is case-sensitive.

- Python thinks that upper- and lower-case letters are different,
  so `Name` and `name` are different variables.
- There are conventions for using upper-case letters at the start of variable names
  so we will use lower-case letters for now.

## Use meaningful variable names.

- Python doesn't care what you call variables as long as they obey the rules
  (alphanumeric characters and the underscore).

```python
flabadab = 42
ewr_422_yY = 'Ahmed'
print(ewr_422_yY, 'is', flabadab, 'years old')
```

- Use meaningful variable names to help other people understand what the program does.
- The most important "other person" is your future self.

## Swapping Values

Draw a table showing the values of the variables in this program
after each statement is executed.
In simple terms, what do the last three lines of this program do?

```python
x = 1.0
y = 3.0
swap = x
x = y
y = swap
```

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```
swap = x  #  x->1.0 y->3.0 swap->1.0
x = y     #  x->3.0 y->3.0 swap->1.0
y = swap  #  x->3.0 y->1.0 swap->1.0
```

These three lines exchange the values in `x` and `y` using the `swap`
variable for temporary storage. This is a fairly common programming idiom.

## Predicting Values

What is the final value of `position` in the program below?
(Try to predict the value without running the program,
then check your prediction.)

```python
initial = "left"
position = initial
initial = "right"
```

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```python
initial = "left"  # Initial is assigned the string "left"
position = initial  # Position is assigned the variable initial, currently "left"
initial = "right"  # Initial is assigned the string "right"
print(position)
```

```output
left
```

The last assignment to position was "left"

## Can you slice integers?

If you assign `a = 123`,
what happens if you try to get the second digit of `a`?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

Numbers are not stored in the written representation,
so they can't be treated like strings.

```python
a = 123
print(a[1])
```

```error
TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable
```

## Choosing a Name

Which is a better variable name, `m`, `min`, or `minutes`?
Why?
Hint: think about which code you would rather inherit
from someone who is leaving the library:

1. `ts = m * 60 + s`
2. `tot_sec = min * 60 + sec`
3. `total_seconds = minutes * 60 + seconds`

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

`minutes` is better because `min` might mean something like "minimum"
(and actually does in Python, but we haven't seen that yet).

## Slicing

What does the following program print?

```python
library_name = 'social sciences'
print('library_name[1:3] is:', library_name[1:3])
```

1. What does `thing[low:high]` do?
2. What does `thing[low:]` (without a value after the colon) do?
3. What does `thing[:high]` (without a value before the colon) do?
4. What does `thing[:]` (just a colon) do?
5. What does `thing[number:negative-number]` do?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```output
library_name[1:3] is: oc
```

1. It will slice the string, starting at the `low` index and ending an element before the `high` index
2. It will slice the string, starting at the `low` index and stopping at the end of the string
3. It will slice the string, starting at the beginning on the string, and ending an element before the `high` index
4. It will print the entire string
5. It will slice the string, starting the `number` index, and ending a distance of the absolute value of `negative-number` elements from the end of the string
